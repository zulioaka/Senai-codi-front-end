    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s <br>
     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br> 
     remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>
     Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br>
      Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
